# flask-blog
Fully responsive blog implemented in Flask for my Communication Skills for Computer Scientists course. 

All the posts are stored in the "posts" subdirectory as .txt files, which are parsed by the website to update the blog with the newest content. The website also includes an algorithm to calculate reading time based on average reading speeds. 

The blog is fully expandable supporting multiple authors and an infinite amount of posts (as long as GitHub storage permits).
