Tech Talk - Bitcoin

<p>In 3Blue1Brown's youtube video "But how does bitcoin actually work," the YouTuber teaches the viewer what goes on behind the scenes of bitcoin. The video introduces the topic by discussing how ledgers work. As expected, trust can be an issue as maybe one person decides not to pay their share or someone adds transactions for malicious purposes. These issues lead to the introduction of cryptocurrencies (like bitcoin), which are secure and trustworthy ledgers. With the basic idea explained, 3Blue1Brown then goes into the math/cryptography aspect of bitcoin. The YouTuber introduces topics like secret and public keys to explain how digital signatures are created. Proof of work and SHA256 (a cryptographic hash function) are then presented to demonstrate how to keep track of which ledgers are valid. The video then goes into more detail on how bitcoin works, and you can watch it yourself (link at the end of the post).

<p>Overall the video is very educational. As someone who had never dug into the details of bitcoin, the presentation intuitively explains cryptocurrencies. The keys to the explanation were the simple introduction to ledgers and their problems as well as the graphics. 

<p>Without taking ~6 minutes in the beginning to discuss ledgers, the viewer wouldn't have understood the purpose of bitcoin and its math. After all, bitcoin is solving the issue of having to trust the parties involved in transactions through the use of modern cryptography. The video exposes a couple of those issues, like a person adding malicious transactions, and then addresses how bitcoin solves them, including an explanation of how the math behind the solution works. The description of ledgers makes it easy to follow the video later on as everything can be brought back to a problem with physical ledgers and how cryptocurrencies address the issue. 

<p>Outside of the useful ledger explanation, the graphics also have a positive impact on the video.  It's one thing to say "Bitcoin is decentralized by having everyone keep a copy of the ledger" and actually showing multiple characters with their ledger and how they got it. Other than the cool PI characters, going through examples of transactions benefits the viewer. Due to cryptocurrencies being a math-heavy topic, showing the actual numbers while going through potential transactions helps understand what is happening without having to understand every bit of the math. 

<p>As a whole, the video stays relevant and doesn't go too deep into the very complicated math, making the video accessible to most people. Through the use of real-life examples and graphics, 3Blue1Brown makes the presentation easy to understand and quite entertaining. It is made clear that math is just the tool, and the video focuses on how bitcoin solves some transaction issues without just focusing on calculations. If you are looking to explore how cryptocurrencies work, there is a link to the video down below. That is all for this week. Until next time!
